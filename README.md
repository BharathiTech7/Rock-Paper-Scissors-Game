# 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game  

✨ This project is more than just a game — it’s a showcase of my JavaScript skills! From DOM manipulation and event handling to randomized logic and dynamic UI updates,
this Rock-Paper-Scissors game demonstrates how I turn core programming concepts into an interactive, user-friendly experience.Built with Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS, it reflects my ability to write clean, 
functional code while designing a smooth and engaging interface. 🚀
